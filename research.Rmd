# Overview

I am generally interested in applying statistics and probability theory to problems in ecology and evolution. I am particularly interested in microbial ecology and how microbial interactions influence changes at the genetic level. 

I am currently developing empirical amino acid [block substitution matrices](blosum.html) using metagenomic data to understand amino acid substitution models in microbes.

I also working on a workflow for understanding [protein cluster variance](protein_clusters.html)

More to come...
