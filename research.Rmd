# Overview

I am generally interested in applying probability theory and statistics to problems in genomics and evolutionary biology. 

As an example of a recent work, I worked on evaluating non-synonymous substituions in a blocks of highly conserved proteins. See [protein cluster variance](protein_clusters.html) to learn more.

More to come.
